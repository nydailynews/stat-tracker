## How to set up your dev environment

1. Clone this repo to your computer
2. Create a virtual environment for this project: `mkvirtualenv STAT` or something like that. 
  * If you don't have `mkvirtualenv` on your machine:
    1. `pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper`
    2. `echo "export WORKON_HOME=~/Env" >> ~/.bashrc`
    3. `echo "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bashrc`
    4. `source ~/.bashrc`
3. Install the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to set up Oauth authentication for downloading data from sheets

[This article is marginally useful](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/service-accounts), but here's the essence:

1. If you don't have a project in [GoogleAPI's console](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/projects), create a project.
2. [Create a service account under that project](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/serviceaccounts-zero).
3. Once the service account is created, create a key for that account.
4. Share the spreadsheet with the email address for that key (it should have "@developer.gserviceaccount.com" in it)
5. Set the ACCOUNT_KEY env var to the private key value.

## How to create a new tracker

### How to get the back-end running

1. Open the shared Sports spreadsheet (in Google Drive, if you don't have access ask Boniface)
2. Create a new tab and give it a name. The name must be all-lowercase, also, use hyphens instead of spaces.
3. Update [deploy.bash](deploy.bash) with the name of the new tab.

### How to get the front-end displaying the data

Basically: Look at how it was done on the [Broncos Sacks Tracker](www/broncos-sacks-2016.html) and take it from there.

## How to update the [Broncos Sacks Tracker](http://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/14/denver-broncos-sack-tracker-2016/) for a new year

1. Open the shared Sports spreadsheet (in Google Drive, if you don't have access ask Boniface)
2. Create two new tabs: broncos-sacks-YEAR and broncos-sacks-by-player-YEAR
3. The layout for the new tabs should look like the previous years' sheets.
4. Add a row (insert it in row 2) in the broncos-sacks-per-season for the new year, give it a value of 0.
5. Copy the previous year's html file (such as [www/broncos-sacks-2016.html](www/broncos-sacks-2016.html) and edit these lines:
  * [The title element](www/broncos-sacks-2016.html#L7)
  * [Each instance of the article URL in the head](www/broncos-sacks-2016.html#L9)
  * [Each instance of the old year in the body](www/broncos-sacks-2016.html#L151)
6. Add the new html file to the repo, upload it to extras (in the app folder, in stat-tacker).
7. Update [deploy.bash](deploy.bash) with the names of the two new tabs.
8. SSH to prod, cd to the project directory, activate the virtual env and run ./deploy.bash
